# A Lifetime-Management Primitive for Trivially Relocatable Types

The latest PDF for this paper is available
[here](https://camio.github.io/trivially_relocate_primitives/trivially_relocate_primitives.pdf).

## Building

This paper is written in typst and can be built with that tool. I recommend
using `typst watch trivially_relocate_primitives.typ` and monitoring the output
with `evince` (or `okular` on Windows) for interactive development.
